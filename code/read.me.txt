I just visualised plot year with Assault.

I was thinking to plot line graph something time period with number of Assualt(multiple line)
but as we only has few month data,
I just decided to plot each year as bar plot.
some shows the plots are in same pannel to make easy to compare.


Step1 : load data
Step2 : Divided victimisation dataset into 3 different year
Step3 : using ggplot visualised each year how many assault.


We can interpret the graph like, which year what kind of assault reported the most
