# code will not run as the "crime_city.csv" dataset was the original dataset that was too large to be put into the git
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
victim <- read.csv("crime_city.csv", header = TRUE)
head(victim)
```



```{r}
victim1 <- separate(victim, "X.Month.Year", c("day", "month", "year"))
head(victim1)
victim18 <- victim1 %>% filter(year == c(17,18, 19))
unique(victim18$ANZSOC.Group)
assault <- victim18 %>% filter(ANZSOC.Group == c("Serious Assault Not Resulting in Injury", "Non-Aggravated Sexual Assault", "Serious Assault Resulting in Injury", "Common Assault", "Aggravated Sexual Assault"))

write.csv(victim18, "/Users/keirynhart/Documents/victims_filtered.csv")
```



```{r}
