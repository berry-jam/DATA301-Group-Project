## 2 Ethics, Privacy and Security

#### 2.1 Ethical considerations

Domestic violence is a sensitive topic and care must be taken when drawing conclusions and reasoning around this.

#### 2.2 Privacy concerns 

Data is already anonymised when it is published onto the police nz website so there isnt alot of concern around privacy. 

Identifying areas may cause privacy concerns if the areas are too specific.

#### 2.3 Secure project management

Private github repository to store data ensuring that only those with an access invitation may access the files.
